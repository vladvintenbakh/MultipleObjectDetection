# Multiple_Object_Detection

The notebook uses pretrained SSD Mobilenet model to complete multiple object detection task on custom images (with 2 objects). The folder with the dataset and configuration files can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w8r3TO975ekBWX1j5ge-x-yDWKyrI1tK?usp=sharing). The entire process from data preprocessing to training and inference was carried out using TensorFlow in Google Colab (GPU).

As of the current model state, the confidence level to display the bounding box for the second object was not enough. The model can be improved further to address this issue.
